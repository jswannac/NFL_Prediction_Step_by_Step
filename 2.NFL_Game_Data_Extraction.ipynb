    "# Turning Play-By-Play Data into Game Data\n",
    "In the <a href=\"\">previous notebook in this series</a>, we cleaned a large .csv file of NFL play-by-play data from 2009-2018. In cleaning the data, I saved multiple gigabytes of memory usage. The final goal here is to use this data to build models that will predict NFL game outcomes more accurately than any human expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest approach, and the approach used here, is to change the play data into summarized statistics for each game. Once the per-game summary statistics are finished, we can calculate per-team and per-season averages. We can also turn the per-game statistics into a stat line of a team's performance in a given season before a given game but NOT including the statistics for that particular game. This stat line, of statistics in a certain season up to but not including a certain game, is critical. Why? It represents our ability to predict that game using all information available before the game starts. In other words, this is the data someone would actually have access to before predicting a real game. These summary vectors are also what will be input into our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, that is a later step. First, we must extract the per-game features from the play-by-play data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extracting Game Stats from Play-By-Play\n",
    "The play-by-play data contains statistics for all NFL games from 2009-2018. In other words, it is every single play in ten season's worth of games for all 32 NFL teams. While this might seem like a lot of plays, the data set is much smaller than typical machine-learning data sets in terms of how many observations it has. Moreover, the reduced set of per-game and per-season statistics for each team will be orders of magnitude smaller than most ML datasets. This will have relevance to fitting and testing our models later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We track the same data for each game, regardless of the year or the teams. The data also gets calculated in the same way for every game, even though there are about 2500 games total. We can calculate data for the home team and the away team, which effectively doubles the number of game statistic summaries to 5000. The main point is that it's the exact same data points and same method of calculating those points for each game. Hence, it makes sense to create a class that represents each game, and simply create an instance of that class for each team in each game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic description of the NFLGame class\n",
    "The NFLGame class uses Pandas to sum up individual stats. Some statistics, such as time of possession, require more complicated calculations and have methods in the NFLGame class defined for them. Offensive stats and defensive stats for the given team are calculated using dataframes sliced from the input frame for offense and defense. After calculation, offensive stats and defensive stats are built into dictionaries and returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "A final, comprehensive dictionary representing the entire game is built from the offensive stats dictionary, the defensive stats dictionary, and a few other general stats about the game. These general stats include items such as whether this team is the home or away team and the finishing point differential. The latter is particularly important, as it will serve as the label in training the machine learning and neural network models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NFL game class is initialized with a Pandas dataframe containing all the data for one NFL game and the name of a team, taken as a 2 or 3-letter string. The team given should match one of the two teams in the game. The class then calculates a wide variety of offensive stats and defensive stats, along with other basics information like which season the game belongs to (for example, a game on January 1st, 2019 will actually go with games from the 2018 season and not the 2019 season).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a given football game (from the real world) can make two different NFLGame objects, one for the away team and one for the home team. This is because data is tracked across the season for each given team, so we want to extract game stats for one team in order to agglomerate them with other stats from the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full code for the NFLGame class can be seen below. It is long due to calculating many different statistics for a given game. As to which features in particular are extracted, scroll below the code for discussion."

    "# Feature Selection\n",
    "At this point, it is best to cast a wide net in terms of extracting features. While future models may or may not need all the features extracted, it is better to extract more features now and throw them out later if modelling shows them to have little impact. Why? Because it is impossible to measure the impact of a feature unless it has been extracted and used to train and test some type of model. If we only chose a few features and did not test them against others, how could we be sure we've made a reasonable choice? Furthermore, while an extremely large dataset with billions of items might demand a more stringent reduction at this stage, the NFL data set is relatively small in terms of games, so a stringent reduction in features is unnecessary at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In selecting features, I favored first-order statistics such as total passes and completed passes over things like completion rate (which is the simple division of completed passes by total passes). Why? Because a neural network or other machine-learning method may be able to discover sublter relationships between the two that are more predictive of game outcomes than simple division. For example, does someone who throws only a few passes and completes nearly all do better than someone who throws far more but completes a lower proportion? And how does the number of passes thrown and caught relate to things like running yards? A simpler measure like completion percentage may leave out such complex relationships, which the neural network and other ML methods can discover and utilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "By a similar logic, I extracted features like total start position on the field plus number of offensive drives rather than dividing them to get average starting field position.\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of Features and Verification of Accuracy\n",
    "The following code snippet opens the big pickle file of all plays in the NFL from 2009-2018, which was produced in the <a href=\"\">data cleaning notebook preceding this one</a>. From this larger data set, it extracts the offensive and defensive stats for the Dallas Cowboys from the December 17th, 2017 game between the Cowboys and the Oakland Raiders. \n",
    "\n",
    "To verify the accuracy of these calculations, the extracted stats are then compared with 3rd party stats (specifically, those from <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201712170rai.htm\"> pro-football-reference.com</a>).\n"

    "# Discussion of discrepancies\n",
    "Negative ones, as noted above, indicated that the 3rd party does not have a statistic corresponding to the extracted feature. Specifically, pro-football-reference.com does not appear to track air yards, yards after catch, total offensive start position (IE, the sum of starting field position for each offensive drive), or total defensive start position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these, a few differences jump out when examining the sheet. The number of passes attempted is slightly different, with my calculations getting 2 more passes attempted than the third party statistics. The number of pass attempts is a simple sum along a column, so a mathematical error is unlikely. Rather, the discrepancy may arise from a slightly different tabulation of pass attempts. The spreadsheet seems to count pass attempts in penalized plays, whereas the third party stats may not. The third party stats might also count interceptions or negative-yardage passing plays differently from the spreadsheet. A minor difference in number of attempted rushes likely stems from a similar cause. I suspect the 1 yard difference in rushing arises from my code specifically discounting the -1 yard resulting from kneeldowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second notable difference is in time of possession. The code in the NFLGame class calculates this by subtracting the number of seconds on the game clock in one play from the subsequent play, and totalling all of these over a drive. However, it does not count passage between drives (IE, on special teams plays). Hence, there is a slight discrepancy, and the number of seconds does not add up to 3600 (the number of seconds in one hour of game time). However, this difference should not matter too much as long as time-of-possession is calculated consistently across teams and across seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the number of first downs earned and opponent's first downs earned differs between my calculated stats and the third party stats. This is, again, due to a difference in calculation. My code calculates this stat as the sum of rushing first downs, penalty first downs, and passing first downs. My statistic does not include things like receiving a kickoff. The third party stats may calculate it in a slightly different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extracting stats for every team and every game\n",
    "Now that we have the class written that represents one team's statistics for one game, we can use a simple loop to get all the stats per team per game for the entire dataset, representing every NFL game from 2009-2018. The code below does this."

    "From here, we'll move into changing our per-game stats into a form suitable to input into machine-learning algorithms. Specifically, as described above, we need a form that summarizes all the information available to someone BEFORE a given game starts, but not including anything about that game that wouldn't be known ahead of time. Specifically, we would know an average or other summary of all game statistics occuring for all games in taht season before the current one, plus a prior season average (or two or more season back). We would also know whether the current game is played at home or away. Hence, what we need is a vector that combines all of these.\n",
